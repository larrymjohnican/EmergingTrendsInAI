# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

1. **Briefly explain the work that I did on this project: What code was I given? What code did I create myself?**

   For this project, I tackled the task of developing a pirate intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze to retrieve treasure using a deep Q-learning algorithm. Initially, I was provided with starter code, comprising Python files and Jupyter Notebook templates. This code laid out the basic framework for the maze environment and included essential functionalities. My primary responsibility was to complete the Q-Training Algorithm section within the Jupyter Notebook. In doing so, I had to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm to empower the pirate agent to identify the most efficient path to the treasure.

2. **Connect my learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
   - **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
   - **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

   As a computer scientist, I engage in the analysis, design, and implementation of algorithms, systems, and applications aimed at solving complex problems and enhancing efficiency across various domains. Our role is pivotal in driving innovation, advancing technology, and shaping the future of society. When approaching a problem, I follow a systematic approach: breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components, identifying patterns or structures, designing efficient algorithms, and implementing robust solutions using programming languages and computational tools.

3. **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

   My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist extend to both end users and organizations. It's imperative that I prioritize the safety, privacy, and security of user data and systems. This involves adhering to ethical principles and standards throughout the software development lifecycle, transparently communicating the capabilities and limitations of technologies, and considering the potential social impact of my work. Upholding ethical standards not only ensures the well-being and rights of users and stakeholders but also contributes to the positive advancement of society through responsible innovation and decision-making.
